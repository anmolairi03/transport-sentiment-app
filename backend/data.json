We have 2 kids (10 and 5) and are planning to live in separate houses (he will live in a house we own and I will live in an apartment we own, without our parents).\n\nWe don’t plan to get divorced on paper since our fianances, investments, assets and expenses are tangled and we both are not considering remarriage also.\n\nBoth of us are financially independent.\n\nHere’s my ask- a lot of my friends stay in unhappy marriages and some of them are of the opinion that a single woman is not treated very well in the society. Where I live is not a  backward society but it is also not large enough like a Metro city to remain anonymous also.\n\nMany women I know stay in unhappy marriages because they view marriage as a safety net socially.\n\nI want to hear experiences from divorced or separated women as to how their life has been after marriage.\n\nThere is no issue of abuse or cheating- he is my childhood friend, and we married young and been married for more than a decade but we have grown apart over the years, don’t communicate and are just like two strangers living in the same house and i am unable to bear living like this.\n\nIs life easier if I just play along and continue living like this for the safety net of ‘marriage’?\n\nWhat do you wish you knew before you got separated? Is life better off alone?\n\nEdit: Please stop suggesting how we can reconcile. We’ve been through all of that for years together now. ",

I was carrying a bagpack and a trolley bag. A slow train came but i realised that the next one would be a fast. I got down and forgot the bag pack ( i was busy doing something on my phone). I boarded the train and while i was crossing Goregaon i realised i dont have my bagpack. I panicked and called GRP helpline. They asked me the coach number i boarded ( as if anyone even reads the coach number in local) . I just knew the timing of the train. They told that they would get it checked in andheri which ofcourse they didnt.\nI went further and got down at Mumbai central and waited for the train i had got down from. ( i checked mindicator) \nI literally got down at every station and hopped different compartments , to find nothing. \nI got down at churchgate and confirmed with the driver if this is the same train to which he answered in negative.\nI was literally sad and i knew that i had lost it. I was almost going to the station master after talking to the police. They were pretty sure that i wouldnt find my bag.\nTo my surprise, there comes a guy with my bagpack walking towards the station master.\nTrust me, happiness and emotions ran through every vein of my body. He confirmed my name and whats in my bag.\nThat guy had to get down at Mumbai central but he came down till h churchgate  just in hope that he might find the owner.\n\nThis is one of the craziest thing happened to me in Aamchi Mumbai.

    "text": "Weird incident in metro Bengaluru Today while taking metro to Cubbon park, I had very weird incident involving a lady. I was on a call on my earphones and there was a lady sitting infront of wearing the TCs company badge me ) .. initially it was all ok ,, I was talking on a call. Suddenly after a couple of stops, she started raising her legs (straightening from knee to feet) and pointing towards me while staring at me. It was a little strange but I ignored it thinking she might be stretching her leg. Then she did that again with her another leg and this time around  other people were also watching her - all were bewildered why she's doing that. As I continued with my regular business , calls - she did the strangest thing - came closer and stepped on my foot - very clearly. There was no crowd absolutely - all were watching. When I told her that you just stepped on my foot, she denied - became belligerent , and started shouting and denying. I realised that something's off and she's trying to pick up a fight, and went away from that place .. she followed me 2 bogies and followed me. When I told her why was she following me - she just said that why are u talking to\nMe , I asked her what have I done to offend her - when she started shouting again \"why are u talking to me\" , \"don't talk to me\". Clearly it seemed like she was trying to pick a fight in public. I just ignored her and continued doing my own thing - when she kept standing beside me. It became so weird - I had to step out of the metro. What was amusing is she seemed like a normal person corporate going person possibly in her late 20s. But this kind of harassing behaviour was unprecedented and uncalled for. \nPosting here just to\nMake people aware and to see if something like this has happened with anyone else. ",

People who live within 15km of their workplace, using personal vehicles, why aren't you switching to e-cycles at-least in spring, winter & summer seasons when there's less chances of rainfall? You could beat traffic & autorickshaw fare abuse by using footpaths (I know it's illegal but at-least it isn't as dangerous) , save on transport charges, save on energy, take your e-cycle battery home or to work to recharge (thereby any last mile anxiety associated with electric vehicles is taken care of). I totally understand traffic woes and I'm only saying this a workaround. \n\nWith at-least 50km range - you needn't worry about pedaling too.\n\nIs it an image thing \"log kya kahengey\" that's keeping people from switching?\n\n  \nP.S: I'm not an e-cycle salesman.\n\n",

We were stuck for over an hour near K R puram. While waiting, I was glancing around, and that’s when I made brief eye contact with a man in another car he seemed to be with his family too.\nTo my shock and disgust, he had the audacity to make a kissing gesture at me. I was so taken aback that I immediately looked away. I wish I’d had the presence of mind to call him out or even just flip him off, but with my family around, I just couldn’t bring myself to react.\nAs if that wasn’t enough, later that same night, a random delivery guy had the nerve to wink at me. Two completely unsolicited, disgusting encounters in the span of just a few hours.\nIt’s honestly infuriating how some men have absolutely no sense of respect or decency. No matter the setting public spaces, heavy traffic, even when they’re with their own families they behave shamelessly. It’s exhausting and gross.\n",

This will be my first time in Jaipur, and I'll be staying close to the Badi Chaupar metro station. \n\n\nWhat I'm interested in:\n\n1. Local, authentic food & street food \n2. Cultural and heritage sites\n3. Anything related to history, literature, art\n4. Anything offbeat, any hidden gems, less people and more nature \n\nWhat I'm NOT interested in:\n\n1. Shopping \n2. Temples (I can make an exception if it's a heritage site) \n3. Cafes, malls, urban attractions\n4. Any place which is too crowded (can make an exception for food places) \n\n\nI want to make the most of my 2 days in Jaipur, and I'm traveling solo. Pour in your suggestions! Thank you so much!",

You can see a small Uturn which is built under the flyover which brings us to the entrance of Lulu Mall. But this Uturn has a gate, and it's closed whenever I go that way mostly during weekends. When it's closed we'll have to go towards Vytilla side through edappally bypass  and take the Uturn towards Edappally Signal and then go to Lulu Mall(This route has heavy traffic block and we lose a lot of time). The thing is I have already taken that Uturn previously once and why close it now? What is the purpose of that Uturn if that's not meant for taking, which saves a lot of time who's going to Lulu Mall? Any idea on this guys?\n\nI'm someone who spends a decent amount of time both in Bangalore and Kochi every month. I haven't seen this kind of an stupid UTurn in Bangalore, tbh.",

    "text": "OP's First Solo Long Distance Train Journey Incoming a Super Long Journey Post from a RailFan Perspective:-\n\nSo This was my First Ever Solo Long Distance Train Ride as a Return Trip after taking Sealdah Rajdhani's 25th Anniversary Run and I was Onboard India's First & Once the Fastest Duronto i.e. 12260 Bikaner - Sealdah Duronto Express via NDLS,CNB,DDU,DHN,DKAE from New Delhi upto Sealdah and here are the pictures along with the Description of my Travel Experience :)\n\n1:-#30468 SDAD P7(Ex-HWHE)equipped with WBL-85HR Single Arm High Rise Pantograph with BTIL Propulsion and Siemens Hotel Load System(This Train has a Regular Link of High Rise Pantos due to the section prior to NDLS being a High Rise One).\n\n2:-Just a Side Face Photo of the Beast 🫡\n\n3:-My Favourite Kind of picture of the Platform Mini Display Board with the Train Number On Screen.\n\n4:-My Coach for that Day was B2-63(Side Lower)(Coach Number:-(ER - 112117C) of Duronto Livery..This Coach was Originally Alloted to 2260 that is why it has the Duronto Livery and the Coach Manufacturing Year also confirms it.\n\n5:-Picture of the Dinner that was served that day.\nNDLS Base Kitchen Rarely Disappoints and it didn't disappointed that day.The Dry Veg was really awesome and the Paneer was decent as well.Just Regular Normal Rice and Dal was bit too light to my liking but otherwise satisfactory.A good (7.5/10) if I had to rate.\n\n6:-A Random Long Exposure Shot at 130km/hr :)\n\n7:-Overtaking 12596 Anand Vihar Terminal - Gorakhpur Humsafar Express at Kanpur Central Outer(Yeah 12596 somehow got ahead of us from SBB and remained ahead of us).\n\n8:-Arrived Kanpur Central 10mins Delayed.\n\n9:-Thrashing through North Central Railway(NCR) at 130km/hr.(CNB-PRYJ Section)\n\n10:-Arrived Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyay Jn. 10mins Before Time.\n\n11:-A Picture of the Breakfast that was served the next Morning.The Breakfast was Good as well I would say.Other than the Cutlets being a bit soggy everything else was upto the mark.A Good (8/10) imo.\n\n12:-Cruising through ECR(East Central Railway)(DDU-DHN Section)\n\n13:-Arrived Dhanbad Jn 8mins Delayed\nThe picture is of the Dhanbad Loco Siding.It was good to see a few familiar Locos standing there(The 1st P7 in the pic is #37552 GMOE P7 whose Ride I have taken earlier on a different train)\n\n14:-Picture of the Lunch that was Served(Recently Introduced)There was no Lunch offered earlier on 12260 but after the new Time Table where it got slowed down 10mins between DHN and SDAH they had to put Lunch.The DHN Base Kitchen from where it was Boarded is ngl really bad.The Paneer was mehhh..The Dal was almost Water.The Rice was fine..The only good combo was the Rice and Dry Veg(Apparently the Dry Veg is made in the Pantry Car which I came to know later since it tasted exactly the same as the Dinner one).On a Scale I would rate this Lunch (4/10). Wouldn't have gotten that 4 if the Dry Veg and Rice weren't Satisfactory.\n\n15:-A Picture right after Baranagar Road(BARN).One can see Kolkata Metro's Blue on the side.\n\n16:-Arriving Sealdah and spotting my favourite genre of Local Trains,The 3-Phase ICF Trains(In Frame is 23XXXX RHA CS Rake)\n\n17:-Arrived Sealdah 20mins Before Time\n\n18:-A Picture with the P7(Talked with the ALP afterwards and he told me that the Birdstrike happened at around Kalipahari Station(After Asansol Jn.)\n\nOn an Overall Note:-\nThis was definitely one of the more Iconic Journeys of my Lifetime considering it being my First Solo Ride and also the Run being amazing throughout.\nBut seeing this Train now just disappointing considering where is this Train right now compared what it was prior to Covid-19\nThis Train used to depart at 20:05 from NDLS and reach SDAH at 12:25 but now the Train has been slowed down by nearly 1.5hrs and with Unnecessary Halt like Koderma Jn. thus killing it's Average Speed from a staggering 90km/hr to 82.5km/hr.The All Duronto Livery Coaches are just gone and it runs with a Mix of Rajdhani,Duronto and Humsafar Livery Coaches.Ignoring that which I cannot alter since it's completely under Indian Railways's Control It was a good experience (P.S.:-I was also going to post a few Important 130km/hr Skips like Fatehpur,Chunar Jn and Durgapur but Reddit doesn't let's you post Picture and Videos together)\n\nThanks for Reading the Post and hopefully I could help someone with their Travel Planning through this\nSigning Off :)",

Hi guys, I've created this website to display the map of all the routes of the trains which pass through your given train station.\n\nhttp://13.61.27.152:5000/\n\nJust enter your station code in the box and submit.\n\nIt was useful for me as when i was staying in Hyderabad I was looking for routes from my hometown in Uttarakhand (small station) a direct train which reaches closest to Hyderabad. And I found the bengaluru special train which goes till Warangal. It really helped me when I had huge luggage.\n\nYou can give your feedback please.\n\n\nExample: \nhttps://postimg.cc/YLtnzVcz",
