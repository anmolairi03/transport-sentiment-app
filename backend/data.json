So today as regular I go I took a  bus for my college and it was very crowded, but after some time It reduced to an extent and I got a seat along with my friend and my phone was constantly in my hand , but as our stoppage came he had to stand up and go so I put my phone in my pocket and proceed to move , while the stoppage came closer more and more people came near the bus gate and I thought all were same university students , just after I stepped down and the bus started moving , I put my hands in my pocket and see there's nothing that made me super super nervous and from my friend phone I called my number immediately but it was switched off . Immediately I rushed to the nearest police station and complaint a fir but I don't think I could find my phone anymore I tried everything like google find my phone and stuff but nothing works I think they formatted the phone as the emails where also logged out . I did block my number immediately but . Still it meant a lot to me as it was my first phone which I was recently gifted by my parents. \nIf anyone could help me it would be a a hugee help . \nAnd to all the people watching this pls be safe.

    "text": "Advice is in the end, this is my story.\n\nI can understand you. My phone was stolen in August 2023. It was my first phone, used by my mom and then handed down to me. It was worth next to nothing, but I was really attached to it.\n\nThe theft didn’t happen in my home district. The police there even refused to register an FIR and just asked me to submit an “application.” I did, but nothing happened. I also submitted a block request on CEIR myself, nothing again.\n\nMy parents contacted someone in the police from our home district. As he advised, they reported the phone as “Lost in our home district\" and informed him later. (not sure if FIR or criminal activity was registered)\n\nAfter 3 months of no updates, i lost hope.\n\nThen last month, my mom sent me a photo from the police station. It showed that my phone had been activated. Their system displayed the name and address of the person whose SIM was inserted. He was from the adjacent district to where my phone had been stolen. That guy finally switched it on after more than 1.5 years.\n\nWe contacted the person and he denied everything and the number is switched off ever since. We'll be taking further action.\n\nADVICE: \nStrictly from my experience, police from outside your home district or state will be of less assistance. Register the complaint in your home police station and its better if you know someone there. Waiting is all you can do after that. Don't get your hopes up too high. From what i heard, the cautious ones just dismantle the phone and sell untraceable components.\n\nADVICE for NEW PHONE so that the thief can do nothing till the battery lasts(these have their inconveniences but are foolproof):\nTurn on \"password for switch off'.\nTurn off the access to the notification bar when the phone is locked so the thief can't turn off mobile data and gps.\nBuy an e-sim mobile, the thief can't remove sim to turn data off and tracing the phone is very easy by find my phone or through police(Above two are still useful if you can't buy e-sim phone)\n\nI still do hope you get your phone back.",

    "text": "Only in Mumbai…. This was a few years ago. I was travelling from Borivali to Bandra via local where my friend would pick me up . I had a flight to catch early morning. I was carrying a bagpack and a trolley bag. A slow train came but i realised that the next one would be a fast. I got down and forgot the bag pack ( i was busy doing something on my phone). I boarded the train and while i was crossing Goregaon i realised i dont have my bagpack. I panicked and called GRP helpline. They asked me the coach number i boarded ( as if anyone even reads the coach number in local) . I just knew the timing of the train. They told that they would get it checked in andheri which ofcourse they didnt.\nI went further and got down at Mumbai central and waited for the train i had got down from. ( i checked mindicator) \nI literally got down at every station and hopped different compartments , to find nothing. \nI got down at churchgate and confirmed with the driver if this is the same train to which he answered in negative.\nI was literally sad and i knew that i had lost it. I was almost going to the station master after talking to the police. They were pretty sure that i wouldnt find my bag.\nTo my surprise, there comes a guy with my bagpack walking towards the station master.\nTrust me, happiness and emotions ran through every vein of my body. He confirmed my name and whats in my bag.\nThat guy had to get down at Mumbai central but he came down till h churchgate  just in hope that he might find the owner.\n\nThis is one of the craziest thing happened to me in Aamchi Mumbai.

They were heading to Electronic City, I think.**\n\nBut what caught my attention was the number of people discussing ways to set **location-based reminders** on their phones — something that could **wake you up as you approach your stop**, so you don’t have to keep checking anxiously.\n\nA smart idea someone mentioned:  \nSet **two reminders** — one for your actual stop, and one for the stop just *before* it. That way, you get a heads-up and time to prepare.\n\nBelow are the steps to configure these location based reminders on almost any phone\n\nFor Android Users\n\n# Using Google Keep (Pre-installed on Many Devices)\n\n1. Open **Google Keep** app.\n2. Tap the **plus (+)** icon to add a new note.\n3. Write your reminder (e.g., “Wake up at Central Station”).\n4. Tap the **reminder (bell)** icon at the top.\n5.

Almost every other night, some part of the stretch between Silk Board and Tin Factory is blocked or diverted. Even after 10 PM, traffic piles up like it’s 6 PM.\n\nPeople are saying it’s due to Namma Metro construction, but there’s hardly any official communication or proper signs around. If Metro work is the reason shouldn’t they be planning better diversions or at least informing commuters?\n\nFlyovers are supposed to ease traffic not become choke points at night too.",

If it’s closed chances are the cops are checking below the flyovers. \n\nNot saying this is a bad thing, offenders need to be punished. Maybe it is a coincidence, but observed a few times.",

We were stuck for over an hour near K R puram. While waiting, I was glancing around, and that’s when I made brief eye contact with a man in another car he seemed to be with his family too.\nTo my shock and disgust, he had the audacity to make a kissing gesture at me. I was so taken aback that I immediately looked away. I wish I’d had the presence of mind to call him out or even just flip him off, but with my family around, I just couldn’t bring myself to react.\nAs if that wasn’t enough, later that same night, a random delivery guy had the nerve to wink at me. Two completely unsolicited, disgusting encounters in the span of just a few hours.\nIt’s honestly infuriating how some men have absolutely no sense of respect or decency. No matter the setting public spaces, heavy traffic, even when they’re with their own families they behave shamelessly. It’s exhausting and gross.\n",

    "text": "I Lost my Father — And the Hospital Walked Away Without Accountability. EHCC-Jaipur Earlier this year, my father traveled from our hometown to Jaipur for a Total Knee Replacement (TKR). As someone who had undergone an open-heart bypass (CABG) surgery in 2015, I was cautious about every step of this medical process. I live in Hyderabad and flew down to Jaipur to personally help him select a multi-speciality hospital—one that could manage complications if they arose.\n\nMy father, a strong and hopeful man, travelled overnight by bus to Jaipur. The orthopedic surgeon examined him and confirmed he was fit for TKR—but as a standard procedure due to his past CABG, we were advised to get a cardiac clearance.\n\nWe got a DSE (Dobutamine Stress Echo) test done. The results showed some abnormalities, and the cardiologist suggested an angiography. But I was wary. Big hospitals often push for stent placements even when unnecessary. I requested a few days to think it over, but the hospital insisted it be done the same day.\n\nI decided to consult other doctors I trusted. After multiple opinions, we chose to get a CT-Angio at EHCC Hospital, a reputed facility in Jaipur. I personally asked the cardiologist there—**twice**—whether this would be safe, given my father’s history. He gave us **200% assurance**.\n\nWe proceeded with both CT-Angio and then the conventional angiography. My father was admitted and prepared for the procedure. He was absolutely fine, joking, chatting, and looking forward to getting better soon.\n\nDuring the angiography, the doctor showed me a live screen and explained that while the main artery looked fine, there was a 90% blockage in a secondary artery. He recommended a stent. Trusting his earlier assurances, I agreed.\n\nThe procedure was declared a success. The doctor congratulated us, and I was allowed to meet my father in the ICU. He was cheerful and said, *“I didn’t even feel anything—it was so quick!”* We spoke for 20 minutes and began planning for discharge.\n\nLater, I left the hospital briefly. Then came the call that changed everything.\n\nThe hospital asked me to return urgently. Alarmed, I called back and demanded to know what had happened. Their first question was, *“Did you give him any blood pressure medicine?”* I was furious. He was in their ICU—**they** were responsible for all medication.\n\nI rushed back, only to be told that my father had suffered a **brain hemorrhage**—caused by blood thinners administered after the angioplasty. A neurosurgeon had been brought in, and they now needed to perform emergency brain surgery.\n\nI was devastated. Just hours earlier, he was smiling and joking. Now, they were saying it was a matter of life and death.\n\nDespite multiple surgeries over the next few days, **my father did not survive**.\n\nWe are shattered. The trauma has left my family in pieces. What hurts most is the way the hospital handled it all—rushing into procedures, pushing decisions, and then absolving themselves when things went horribly wrong.\n\nYes, we signed consent forms. Yes, they are legally covered. But what about **accountability**? What about the human side of healthcare? What about families who lose loved ones due to medical negligence masked as protocol?\n\nWe are still in shock. And while we may never get justice through the courts, I am using this platform to speak up—for my father, and for the countless others who may silently suffer similar fates.\n\nSince this incident, I’ve personally advised many people to **stay away from that hospital**, and I will **keep warning others**. This is the least I can do for my father, and for the families who still believe hospitals are always a safe space.\n\n**Please share this. Let’s not normalize blind trust in the Hospital/Doctor. Ask questions. Get second opinions. And most importantly—hold people accountable.**\n\n",

You can see a small Uturn which is built under the flyover which brings us to the entrance of Lulu Mall. But this Uturn has a gate, and it's closed whenever I go that way mostly during weekends. When it's closed we'll have to go towards Vytilla side through edappally bypass  and take the Uturn towards Edappally Signal and then go to Lulu Mall(This route has heavy traffic block and we lose a lot of time). The thing is I have already taken that Uturn previously once and why close it now? What is the purpose of that Uturn if that's not meant for taking, which saves a lot of time who's going to Lulu Mall? Any idea on this guys?\n\nI'm someone who spends a decent amount of time both in Bangalore and Kochi every month. I haven't seen this kind of an stupid UTurn in Bangalore, tbh.",

    "text": "OP's First Solo Long Distance Train Journey Incoming a Super Long Journey Post from a RailFan Perspective:-\n\nSo This was my First Ever Solo Long Distance Train Ride as a Return Trip after taking Sealdah Rajdhani's 25th Anniversary Run and I was Onboard India's First & Once the Fastest Duronto i.e. 12260 Bikaner - Sealdah Duronto Express via NDLS,CNB,DDU,DHN,DKAE from New Delhi upto Sealdah and here are the pictures along with the Description of my Travel Experience :)\n\n1:-#30468 SDAD P7(Ex-HWHE)equipped with WBL-85HR Single Arm High Rise Pantograph with BTIL Propulsion and Siemens Hotel Load System(This Train has a Regular Link of High Rise Pantos due to the section prior to NDLS being a High Rise One).\n\n2:-Just a Side Face Photo of the Beast 🫡\n\n3:-My Favourite Kind of picture of the Platform Mini Display Board with the Train Number On Screen.\n\n4:-My Coach for that Day was B2-63(Side Lower)(Coach Number:-(ER - 112117C) of Duronto Livery..This Coach was Originally Alloted to 2260 that is why it has the Duronto Livery and the Coach Manufacturing Year also confirms it.\n\n5:-Picture of the Dinner that was served that day.\nNDLS Base Kitchen Rarely Disappoints and it didn't disappointed that day.The Dry Veg was really awesome and the Paneer was decent as well.Just Regular Normal Rice and Dal was bit too light to my liking but otherwise satisfactory.A good (7.5/10) if I had to rate.\n\n6:-A Random Long Exposure Shot at 130km/hr :)\n\n7:-Overtaking 12596 Anand Vihar Terminal - Gorakhpur Humsafar Express at Kanpur Central Outer(Yeah 12596 somehow got ahead of us from SBB and remained ahead of us).\n\n8:-Arrived Kanpur Central 10mins Delayed.\n\n9:-Thrashing through North Central Railway(NCR) at 130km/hr.(CNB-PRYJ Section)\n\n10:-Arrived Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyay Jn. 10mins Before Time.\n\n11:-A Picture of the Breakfast that was served the next Morning.The Breakfast was Good as well I would say.Other than the Cutlets being a bit soggy everything else was upto the mark.A Good (8/10) imo.\n\n12:-Cruising through ECR(East Central Railway)(DDU-DHN Section)\n\n13:-Arrived Dhanbad Jn 8mins Delayed\nThe picture is of the Dhanbad Loco Siding.It was good to see a few familiar Locos standing there(The 1st P7 in the pic is #37552 GMOE P7 whose Ride I have taken earlier on a different train)\n\n14:-Picture of the Lunch that was Served(Recently Introduced)There was no Lunch offered earlier on 12260 but after the new Time Table where it got slowed down 10mins between DHN and SDAH they had to put Lunch.The DHN Base Kitchen from where it was Boarded is ngl really bad.The Paneer was mehhh..The Dal was almost Water.The Rice was fine..The only good combo was the Rice and Dry Veg(Apparently the Dry Veg is made in the Pantry Car which I came to know later since it tasted exactly the same as the Dinner one).On a Scale I would rate this Lunch (4/10). Wouldn't have gotten that 4 if the Dry Veg and Rice weren't Satisfactory.\n\n15:-A Picture right after Baranagar Road(BARN).One can see Kolkata Metro's Blue on the side.\n\n16:-Arriving Sealdah and spotting my favourite genre of Local Trains,The 3-Phase ICF Trains(In Frame is 23XXXX RHA CS Rake)\n\n17:-Arrived Sealdah 20mins Before Time\n\n18:-A Picture with the P7(Talked with the ALP afterwards and he told me that the Birdstrike happened at around Kalipahari Station(After Asansol Jn.)\n\nOn an Overall Note:-\nThis was definitely one of the more Iconic Journeys of my Lifetime considering it being my First Solo Ride and also the Run being amazing throughout.\nBut seeing this Train now just disappointing considering where is this Train right now compared what it was prior to Covid-19\nThis Train used to depart at 20:05 from NDLS and reach SDAH at 12:25 but now the Train has been slowed down by nearly 1.5hrs and with Unnecessary Halt like Koderma Jn. thus killing it's Average Speed from a staggering 90km/hr to 82.5km/hr.The All Duronto Livery Coaches are just gone and it runs with a Mix of Rajdhani,Duronto and Humsafar Livery Coaches.Ignoring that which I cannot alter since it's completely under Indian Railways's Control It was a good experience (P.S.:-I was also going to post a few Important 130km/hr Skips like Fatehpur,Chunar Jn and Durgapur but Reddit doesn't let's you post Picture and Videos together)\n\nThanks for Reading the Post and hopefully I could help someone with their Travel Planning through this\nSigning Off :)",

And I found the bengaluru special train which goes till Warangal. It really helped me when I had huge luggage.\n\nYou can give your feedback please.\n\n\nExample: \nhttps://postimg.cc/YLtnzVcz",

Need it to collect luggage Hey folks,\nI’ve booked a train ticket mainly because I need to collect my bike/parceled luggage at the destination station. The problem is that the train halt there is only 2 minutes, and I might not be able to travel on the train myself, but I need the ticket to remain valid so that I can collect my parcel.\n\nIf I don’t board, will the ticket get auto-cancelled or marked as “not boarded”?\nWill that create issues while collecting my parcel/luggage at the destination?\n\nIs there any way to keep the ticket valid without actually boarding the train?\n\nAny insights from people who’ve dealt with parcel/luggage collection like this would really help!\n\n",
